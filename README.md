Numerical heat transfer is a repository containing numerical methods developed using Computational Fluid Mechanics and Heat Transfer (Anderson, et al) along with Numerical Heat Transfer (ME6335) at Georgia Tech with Dr. Satish Kumar.

Finite volume formulations are used throughout to maintain conservation properties. The project files are a mixture of Python, C++, and MATLAB. Python and C++ are used mainly as the solver while MATLAB is used for post-processing and data visualization.
